# Production
1. Run `npm run build`.  Copy all the files in 
dist/ to wherever you want to serve the game.
2. Change the `manifest` line in index.html to 
`<link rel="manifest" href="./manifest.json">`.
You must do this because Parcel will not leave
it as a JSON file.
3. Copy over `manifest.json`, `service-worker.js`
